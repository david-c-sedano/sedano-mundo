  <h2>Which programming languages are your favorite?</h2>
  <p>
    - Python <br>
    - C <br>
    - x86-64 Assembly<br>
  </p>

  <h2>What Code Editor do you use?</h2>
  <p>
    I use Neovim on my main Linux desktop. Why? Because I like striking cords like a master pianist and watching the cursor jump around. That is what is important to me in a text editor, not AI autocomplete or LSP, but fancy power moves like macros and find-and-replace.

    <br>
    On my Windows laptop I use VSCode like a normal person though.

  <h2>What Linux Distribution do you use?</h2>
  <p>
    I use Gentoo Linux because I download software like a real man. No installers or package managers, I clone the source code and compile. Though I will admit Portage makes it far nicer.
    <br>
    <br>
    Also I can spit on the Arch users. My distro will always be the hardest!
    (yes I use windows for gaming and school, shut up)

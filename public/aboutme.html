    Good evening (or morning!) to whoever is reading this. My name is David Sedano, I am a programmer, and <strong>avant-garde computing aficionado</strong>. I am currently a sophmore in college studying Computer Science.<br><br>

    During my spare time, I like to explore restaurants, and program recreationally.<br><br>

    Seriously, check out some of my projects, or maybe check out my posts which explain how I program things.

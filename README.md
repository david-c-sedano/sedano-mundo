# SEDANO MUNDO
This is the source code for my personal portfolio on the web. The code is quite messy, but that is ok since this is not meant to be a highly scalable application.

## ITS A WORK IN PROGRESS RN
These are the plans

- host on AWS
- make it so that you can type a URL into any browser and be directed here
- maybe do pre-rendering if the performance is crap on mobile devices or smthn

## Directions

make sure you have npm and node installed
`node --version`
`npm --version`

then follow:
`git clone https://github.com/david-c-sedano/sedano-mundo`
`cd sedano-mundo`
`npm install`
`npx vite`

and click the link in the browser

## NOTES 
3d model comes from [here](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/volcano-island-lowpoly-4a6591dc9fee40d8bfda8350683af9af)
The cherry blossom particle comes from [here](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/cherry-blossom-petal-a1e45d9f9796403ca855a6afa4613627)

## MORE NOTES
Originally I was going to put a toon shader on it, but it takes quite a long time and I was doing many things wrong, so I will leave it for later. To make up for it, I added *very* fancy camera movement. I want to move on to other Three.js projects and come back to this, preferably with my own 3d models so things are less of a pain.

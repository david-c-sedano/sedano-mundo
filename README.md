This is the source code for my personal portfolio on the web.

## ITS A WORK IN PROGRESS RN
These are the plans

- apply some kind of toon shader for a cool anime aesthetic
- add some clear UI panels that float on top
- add text and stuff. Nice!
- add some cherry blossom particle effects, to make the sky a little spicier

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
You should have node.js installed, and the `npm` commands should work. This uses a build tool called `vite.js` which handles a lot of the annoying stuff like opening a localhost and getting my JS to do it's stuff. Three.js is the 3d rendering library for the browser, which makes it easy to render 3d objects and worlds. Lastly, I will need to choose on some kind of UI system. I will probably just end up rawdogging it with pure HTML, CSS and JS, but it might be worth to check out Svelte or Preact. Honestly, I don't know since I don't think writing web UIs with HTML/CSS/JS can be THAT painful.

Note - 3d model comes from [here](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/volcano-island-lowpoly-4a6591dc9fee40d8bfda8350683af9af) by animateria. I removed the clouds though
